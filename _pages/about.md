Tao Xinzi
Master of Fine Arts in Design | Renmin University of China

I am a designer and researcher with a strong focus on the integration of design, technology, and cultural heritage. I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Fine Arts in Design from Renmin University of China, where I specialized in design methodology and research. My academic work explores innovative approaches to traditional Chinese design and the use of technology, such as virtual reality and comics, to enhance cultural heritage preservation.

I am the first author of several research papers, including studies on the reinterpretation of Han Dynasty imagery and the integration of virtual reality with comic representations of world heritage sites. My research emphasizes user-centered design, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and the application of design thinking to both traditional and modern contexts.

My academic interests lie at the intersection of design, technology, and cultural preservation, and I am committed to advancing the field through innovative research and design solutions.
